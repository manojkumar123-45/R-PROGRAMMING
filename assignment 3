1. Consider the data set occupationalStatus in the datasets package.
(a) What is the probability of a son having the same occupational status as his father? [Hint:
investigate what diag(x) does if x is a matrix.]
(b) Renormalize the data so that each row sums to 1. In the new data set the ith row
represents the conditional distribution of a sonâ€™s occupational status given that his father has
occupational status i.
(c) What is the probability that a son has occupational status between 1 and 3, given that his
father has status 1?
What if the father has occupational status 8?
library(datasets)
data("occupationalStatus")
prob <- sum(diag(occupationalStatus)) / sum(occupationalStatus)
prob
> prob
[1] 0.2747
occupationalStatus_norm <- apply(occupationalStatus, 1, function(x) x/sum(x))
prob_1to3_given_1 <- occupationalStatus_norm[1,1:3] %*% matrix(1, nrow=3)/3
prob_1to3_given_1
 [,1]
[1,] 0.6981159
prob_1to3_given_8 <- occupationalStatus_norm[8,1:3] %*% matrix(1, nrow=3)/3
prob_1to3_given_8
> prob_1to3_given_8
 [,1]
[1,] 0.2243202


2. Create the following data frame, subsequently invert Gender for all individuals.
a) Name Age Height Weight Gender
Alex 25 177 57 M
Lilly 31 163 69 M
Mark 23 190 83 F
data <- data.frame(
 Name = c("Alex", "Lilly", "Mark"),
 Age = c(25, 31, 23),
 Height = c(177, 163, 190),
 Weight = c(57, 69, 83),
 Gender = c("M", "M", "F")
)
data$Gender <- ifelse(data$Gender == "M", "F", "M")
print(data)
 Name Age Height Weight Gender
1 Alex 25 177 57 F
2 Lilly 31 163 69 F
3 Mark 23 190 83 M
b) Create the below data frame
Name Working
Alex Yes
Lilly No
Mark No
data2 <- data.frame(
 Name = c("Alex", "Lilly", "Mark"),
 Working = c("Yes", "No", "No")
)
print(data2)
 Name Working
1 Alex Yes
2 Lilly No
3 Mark No
c) Add the data frame column-wise to the previous one.
How many rows and columns does the new data frame have?
merged_data <- cbind(data, data2$Working)
print(merged_data)
 Name Age Height Weight Gender data2$Working
1 Alex 25 177 57 F Yes
2 Lilly 31 163 69 F No
3 Mark 23 190 83 M No


3. A student recorded his/her scores on weekly R programming quizzes that were marked out
of a possible 10 points. His/Herscores were as follows:
8, 5, 8, 5, 7, 6, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 6, 6, 9, 8, 9, 7, 9, 9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 7
What is the mode of his/her scores on the weekly R programming quizzes?

INPUT
scores <- c(8, 5, 8, 5, 7, 6, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 6, 6, 9, 8, 9, 7, 9, 9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 7)
mode <- names(table(scores))[table(scores)==max(table(scores))]
print(mode)

OUTPUT
[1] "7"


4. Construct the following data frame.
Countries population_in_million gdp_per_capita
A 100 2000
B 200 7000
C 120 15000
a) Write appropriate R code and reshape the above data frame from wide data format
to long data format.
library(tidyr)
data <- data.frame(
 Countries = c("A", "B", "C"),
 population_in_million = c(100, 200, 120),
 gdp_per_capita = c(2000, 7000, 15000)
)
long_data <- gather(data, key = "variable", value = "value", -Countries)
print(long_data)
 Countries variable value
1 A population_in_million 100
2 B population_in_million 200
3 C population_in_million 120
4 A gdp_per_capita 2000
5 B gdp_per_capita 7000
6 C gdp_per_capita 15000
b) Write R code and reshape from long to wide data format.
wide_data <- spread(long_data, key = "variable", value = "value")
print(wide_data)
 Countries gdp_per_capita population_in_million
1 A 2000 100
2 B 7000 200
3 C 15000 120
