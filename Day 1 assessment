Set I

1. Write a R program to create a vector of a specified type and length. Create
vector of numeric, complex, logical and character types of length 6 with
your own examples. print the vector, type, and length.

Syntax 

x = vector("numeric", 5)
print("Numeric Type:")
print(x)
c = vector("complex", 5)
print("Complex Type:")
print(c)
l = vector("logical", 5)
print("Logical Type:")
print(l)
chr = vector("character", 5)
print("Character Type:")
print(chr)

O/P

[1] "Numeric Type:"
[1] 0 0 0 0 0
[1] "Complex Type:"
[1] 0+0i 0+0i 0+0i 0+0i 0+0i
[1] "Logical Type:"
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
[1] "Character Type:"
[1] "" "" "" "" ""

x = c(10, 20, 30 )
2. Write a R program to find Sum, Mean and Product of a Vector.

Syntax 
 
x = c(10, 20, 30)
print("Sum:")
print(sum(x))
print("Mean:")
print(mean(x))  
print("Product:")
print(prod(x))

O/P

[1] "Sum:"
[1] 60
[1] "Mean:"
[1] 20
[1] "Product:"
[1] 6000    



3.Write a R program to find the minimum and the maximum of a Vector

Syntax

x = c(10, 20, 30, 25, 9, 26)
print("Original Vectors:")
print(x)
print("Maximum value of the above Vector:")
print(max(x))
print("Minimum value of the above Vector:")
print(min(x))

O/P

[1] "Original Vectors:"
[1] 10 20 30 25  9 26
[1] "Maximum value of the above Vector:"
[1] 30
[1] "Minimum value of the above Vector:"
[1] 9         


4.Write a R program to find second highest value in a given vector.

Syntax

x = c(10, 20, 30, 20, 20, 25, 9, 26)
print("Original Vectors:")
print(x)
print("Find second highest value in a given vector:")
l = length(x)
print(sort(x, partial = l-1)[l-1])

O/P

[1] "Original Vectors:"
[1] 10 20 30 20 20 25  9 26
[1] "Find second highest value in a given vector:"
[1] 26     

5. Write a R program to add a new item g4 = &quot;C++&quot; to a given list.
Sample list: (g1 = 5:10, g2 = &quot;R Programming&quot;, g3 = &quot;HTML&quot;)

Syntax

list1 = list(g1 = 1:10, g2 = "R Programming", g3 = "HTML")
print("Original list:")
print(list1)
print("Add a new vector to the said list:")
list1$g4 = "c++"
print(list1)


O/P

[1] "Original list:"
$g1
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$g2
[1] "R Programming"

$g3
[1] "HTML"

[1] "Add a new vector to the said list:"
$g1
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

$g2
[1] "R Programming"

$g3
[1] "HTML"

$g4

6. Write a R program to extract all elements except the third element of the
first vector of a given list.
Sample list: (g1 = 5:10, g2 = &quot;R Programming&quot;, g3 = &quot;HTML&quot;)

Syntax

list1 = list(g1 = 1:10, g2 = "R Programming", g3 = "HTML")
print("Original list:")
print(list1)
print("First vector:")
print(list1$g1)
print("First vector without third element:")
list1$g1 = list1$g1[-3]
print(list1$g1)
